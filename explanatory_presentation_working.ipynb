    "\n",
    "The dataset contains information on nearly 114,000 loans from Prosper. Only loans that had been conclcuded (Paid off succesfully or failed to be paid off) were used for the analysis, which reduced the sample number to 55076. There were loans that were missing values that could not be corrected which resulted in a further 591 loans being removed.\n",

    "Attributes of interest included Loan completion status, BorrowerAPR, Debt-to-income ratio, Term, Loan Origination Quarter, Monthly Loan Payments and Employment status. There were 81 data points per loan, many of which were not relevant for this analysis. This number was reduced to 16 for the intial analysis."
